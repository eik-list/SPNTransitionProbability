# SPNTransitionProbability
Simple C/C++ code for experimenting with weight transition probabilities in AES-like ciphers. The Z-table is essentially the weight distribution of the MDS code used in AES. 

TODO: Apply linear optimization to the state transition probability matrix to find minimal distinguishing complexity.
